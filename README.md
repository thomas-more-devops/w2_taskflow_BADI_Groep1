## 🌟 Key Features Explained

### Local Storage Integration
Tasks are automatically saved to your browser's local storage, ensuring persistence across sessions:

```javascript
// Automatic saving after every change
saveTasks() {
    localStorage.setItem('taskflow_tasks', JSON.stringify(this.tasks));
}
```

### Responsive Design

```css
@media (max-width: 768px) {
    .input-container {
        flex-direction: column;
    }
}
```

### Smooth Animations
CSS transitions and keyframe animations for delightful user experience:

```css
@keyframes slideIn {
    from { opacity: 0; transform: translateY(20px); }
    to { opacity: 1; transform: translateY(0); }
}
```

    // Download as JSON file
}
```
